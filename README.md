Nowadays, watching a movie or a tv program with relatives is uncommon and everyone has their own preferences. As a result, people like to watch movies/shows on their phones or computers. 
<br/>
Presenting BINGEFLIX as a solution to the above problem as an Over-the-top (OTT) platform which provides video and audio content streaming and viewing service for short films, motion pictures, documentaries, and web series.

# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Ant design](https://ant.design/)
- [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
